        I UNDERSTAND: It is my responsibility to post a Reservation Notice at the park bowery no sooner than the morning of my reservations, unless otherwise
        approved through the Corinne City Offices. I may cancel my reservation up to one week in advance for a full refund. My reservations will automatically
        be terminated should Corinne City receive a returned check. Corinne City Corporation has the right to keep my deposit and refuse future rentals to me if deemed necessary.<br />
